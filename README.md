When considering at least 3 features to interpret the diabetes dataset,
the figure comparing BMI, BP, and Y (progression of diabetes after a year) is the best figure
as it can be seen that there is a positive (not very strong, yet positive) correlation between BMI & Y, BMI & BP and BP & Y.
To get to this conclusion, however, I needed to draw out a pairplot & heatmap to ensure I understood which physiological
factors will affect the progression of diabetes.

In taking a look at other plots on the pair plot (as well as the heatmap),
there is a strong, positive correlation between S1 and S2, as well as a strong negative correlation between S3 and S4.
However, this does not provide valuable information in terms of understanding which of these factors affect the progression of diabetes.
